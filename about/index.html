	<h1>What is this?</h1>
	
	<p>In today's world, data is ubiquitous. From retirees, to business people, to children, people are increasingly aware of the data they use and generate. Modern lifestyles with internet connected phones, personal computers, vehicles, and the plethora of Internet of Things devices (TV, appliances, home assistants), generate amounts of data that are difficult to imagine. <a href="https://www.domo.com/learn/data-never-sleeps-6">Americans alone used 3,138,420GB of internet data every minute in 2018,</a> and they used it to better their lives, The Weather Channel received more than 18 million forecast requests every minute, Google conducted more than 3.8 million searches each minute, and Spotify streamed over 750,000 songs each minute. By 2020, it's estimated that for every person on earth, 1.7 MB of data will be created every second.</p>
	
	<p>This page is used to showcase techniques that can be used to investigate interesting and complex questions using data and present it in a form which is approachable to everyone. One of my personal goals with this page is that people will understand how we use data, how they benefit, and hopefully calm some fears about the data they generate. (Which is not to say individuals shouldn't be mindful of the information they share! Bad people do bad things in all parts of life.)</p>
	
	<p>I hope you enjoy the content and join me in the discussions about what data can tell us!</p>
