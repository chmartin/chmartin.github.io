In today's world, data is ubiquitous.

Our modern lifestyles, complete with internet-connected phones, laptops, vehicles, and so on, use up and simultaneously generate amounts of data that are difficult to even imagine. This trend is further accelerating with the spread of the Internet of Things (IoT).

[Americans alone used 3,138,420GB of internet data every minute in 2018](https://www.domo.com/learn/data-never-sleeps-6), and they used it to better their lives. Every minute, The Weather Channel received more than 18 million forecast requests, Google conducted more than 3.8 million searches, and Spotify streamed over 750,000 songs.

By 2020, it's estimated that for every person on Earth, 1.7 MB of data will be created every second. Spurred on by the increasing connectivity of the world. In 2017, internet usage reached 47% of the worlds population (3.8 billion people), and continues to steadily increase.
	
This page was created to showcase techniques that businesses and individuals use to investigate interesting and complex questions using data and present it in a form which is approachable to everyone.

It was inspired by my personal goal to further understanding of how data is employed for the benefit of everyday people, and hopefully alleviate some of the fears that have recently surrounded the use of data in business (which is not to say individuals shouldn't be mindful of the information they share!).

I hope you enjoy the content and join me in the discussions about what data can tell us!
